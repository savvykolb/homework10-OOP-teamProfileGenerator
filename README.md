## Installation
You will need to ensure that you have node.js installed on your device and complete an npm init within your terminal. This application will use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```terminal
node index.js
```

## Usage
You will need to fork and open this application and then open your terminal. Once you open your terminal, you will type ‘node index.js’. You will then answer the prompts to the best of your knowledge. Once all answers are completed, you will see ’Your Team Profile is ready!!’ And a team.html file will be found within the dist folder.
